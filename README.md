# Frandestein_keyboard
_Everything about my (first?) handwired custom split keyboard._

## How it started
Before making this, I was using a [Lily58L](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/n2makg/probably_its_not_the_prettiest_but_im_so_proud_of/) (mainly from Keycapsss.com), then a [CRKBD](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/sgetwt/i_see_a_keyboard_and_i_want_it_painted_black/) (again, mainly from Keycapsss.com). After using both of them (especially the Lily), I felt like I needed a more compact and minimalistic keyboard, so I ended up designing one by myself. I called it Frandestein because that's one of my other nicknames, but also because it was created taking inspiration from other keyboards and built with parts taken from other electronic accessories, so it reminded me of Frankenstein.

## Sources of inspire
For the layout, I took inspiration from the [CRKBD](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and the [Boardsource's Microdox](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92).

For the designing and building processes, these videos were really helpful:
* [How to Design Mechanical Keyboard Plates and Cases](https://youtu.be/7azQkSu0m_U) by Joe Scotto
* [How to Design a Custom Mechanical Keyboard](https://youtu.be/iv__343ZwE0) by Mad Mod Labs
* [How to Build a Handwired Keyboard](https://youtu.be/hjml-K-pV4E) by Joe Scotto
* [Building Handwired Keyboards with Choc Switches](https://youtu.be/Qkx9M-AzznE) by Joe Scotto

## Designing process
I started with editing a _.json_ file of the CRKBD on [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) following the first two videos mentioned above to get the final layout I wanted (sorry, I forgot to save the final _.json_ file...). Then I imported it on kbplate.ai03.com, setting unit width and height to 18 and 17mm. Finally, I downloaded the _.dxf_ file.

Before importing it on Fusion360, I drew a rough sketch of a section view of the keyboard, to understand what would have been the minimum height it could get, considering Choc switch's height and the safest thickness of a 3D printed bottom plate, which I knew is 2mm. Here's the sketch:

As you can see, I also kept note of the nice!nano's dimensions for the final designing process on Fusion, while on the bottom there's what I call [_the tetralobe_](/images/05_bottom_tetralobe.jpg) scheme: it will accommodate one of the four screws (indicated with a _+_ sign) to fix the bottom plate, a magnet (indicated with an _M_), and a little rubber feet (indicated with a _P_), while the fourth hole will accommodate the other half feet. Everything will be clearer with the video at the end.

These are the parts I used for this build:

* 3D printed case (I'll add a link to Thinkverse to download the STL files once I'll fix a problem with my account)

* [Pro Red Choc switches](https://splitkb.com/collections/switches-and-keycaps/products/kailh-low-profile-choc-switches?variant=39459382231117)

* [Blank MBK Choc Low Profile Keycaps](https://splitkb.com/collections/switches-and-keycaps/products/blank-mbk-choc-low-profile-keycaps)

* [2x nice!nano's v2](https://splitkb.com/products/nice-nano)

* [MCU sockets](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/32847506950.html)

* [MSK-12C02 ON/OFF switches](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/4001202080623.html)

* [2x 401235 Li-ion 3,7V 120mAh batteries](https://www.ebay.it/itm/202170224315)

* 2x reset buttons taken from a dead mouse

* 8x neodymium magnets (for the [carrying solution](https://imgur.com/a/YrkXWoG))

* [THT Diodes](https://splitkb.com/products/tht-diodes)

* Various wires taken from an old SCART cable

I hope you find it interesting. I'm here to answere any question.

Have a nice day :)
